Edit out the *brute.cpp* ans *solution.cpp* with your code as the code which is written in both the files are just an example. Make sure you write the bute force code in brute.cpp and optimized code in solution.cpp. Both the codes are in c++ language as the script i have written is compiling c++ files you can change the script accordingly. <br>
Just open the folder in ```command prompt``` 
and
type 
```
stress
```
<br />

Also adjust the *gen.cpp* file according to your question.
